# **iPSL**: iTesla Power System Library:
The iTesla Power System Library is a [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org) library developed as part of the [iTesla project](http://www.itesla-project.eu/).
The library contains a set of power system component models for phasor time domain simulations.

## Notice to Users:
This project encompasses the development of a Modelica library for Power System simulation.
As such, there are no solver tools provided in this repository (no Power Flow Solvers, no Time-Domain solvers, etc.).
You can find more information on the [Wiki - Page](https://github.com/itesla/ipsl/wiki/Overview).

## Documentation:
Currently, we are developing an 'application guide' with examples how to use the library and documentation on many of the test networks developed by different project partners, however, because the iTesla project is still on-going, we are not sure when this material will be ready.

You can follow the following issues to know about our progress: [Application Guide](https://github.com/itesla/ipsl/issues/3) and [Test Networks](https://github.com/itesla/ipsl/issues/4).

## Contributing:
Contributions to the library are welcome and can be submitted in the form of pull requests to this repository.
Contributions can be of different nature, such as addition of a new component model, re-organisation of the structure of the library, change in the development practices, etc.

Please consult the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/itesla/ipsl/wiki/Contributing-home).

## Citing iPSL in Publications:
If you use iPSL in your work or research, all we ask you in exchange is that you **cite the reference publications**, according to your use.
Please consult our [Publication list](https://github.com/itesla/ipsl/wiki/Publications), for browsing the reference publications

You are also welcome to submit your contributions as stated above.

## Copyright assignment:
Each contributor should send an email to info@itesla-ipsl.org with the following sentence:
